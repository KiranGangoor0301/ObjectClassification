# Image Classification using Deep Learning and CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to classify images into ten different classes using deep learning techniques and the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to build a deep neural network model that can accurately classify these images.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset can be obtained from the [CIFAR-10 website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). It contains the following classes:

1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework of your choice)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory should contain the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved model checkpoints and model architecture files.
- `results/`: Evaluation results and visualizations.

## Usage

1. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Preprocess the data by running the data preprocessing notebook or script.

3. Train the model using the training notebook or script. You can choose to use pre-trained models or train from scratch.

4. Evaluate the model using the evaluation notebook or script. This will provide metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations of the model's performance.

## Model

We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification. The architecture may vary based on the specific model you choose to implement or use.

## Results

After training and evaluation, you can find the results in the `results/` directory. This includes accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and saved model checkpoints.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. You can further fine-tune the model, experiment with different architectures, or explore data augmentation techniques to improve classification performance.
